Anticipating and sensitive to any whim I had, accommodating for the parts of the itinerary that was more interesting to me.  The tour itself was of course a somber experience but a lighthearted conversation in the car added some counterweight to that.  He *really* went out of his way to make my stay a memorable one.  This was the highlight of my trip.  I would travel again with Kenan in a heartbeat!",

Anticipating and sensitive to any whim I had, accommodating for the parts of the itinerary that was more interesting to me.  The tour itself was of course a somber experience but a lighthearted conversation in the car added some counterweight to that.  He *really* went out of his way to make my stay a memorable one.  This was the highlight of my trip.  I would travel again with Kenan in a heartbeat!",

Thank you for enjoying that 'lighthearted conversation' as you said, that is the most beautiful part of the tour, to meet new people and get to know them! I can't wait to tour with you again as well!

My partner and I went on this day tour with Kenan and he showed us the real Bosnia and Herzegovina with all of its magic and local hidden spots that we certainly couldn't have found ourselves, and I doubt any other tour guide could give you the same experience -- I can say, having been on many tours in many countries, we haven't had a more fun, relaxing, and also adventure-filled day! We got to learn tons about the rich history of Bosnia, its current-day identity and walked away with a much more nuanced perspective of a country that has seen so much and has such a diverse population. Every location on the tour has tons to add and Kenan connected all the different significances beautifully. To top it off, we really enjoyed just chatting with him about his perspectives on Bosnia and even life, and I'm happy to say walked away with not just a great tour, but also a friend :)  Book this tour!!
